# RL-for-LLMs
This repository serves as a personal collection of code and experiments exploring RL techniques for improving & aligning LLMs. Each folder contains its own detailed README with specific setup instructions, usage examples, and implementation details. All code includes extensive comments because I tend to forget implementation details over time so those are mainly for me to revisit and understand stuff.

## Code Quality
- Code structure may be inconsistent across different experiments as they were developed at different times
- Some implementations may be missing certain details or have incomplete features
- Code is still actually functional.

## Current Implementations
